                <div id="yuta-info">
                    <p>Yuta is a young man of average height with disheveled black hair and dark blue eyes. His body language makes it easy to tell that Yuta is very stressed. His posture is very unconfident, and he has dark eyelids due to lack of sleep.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At his old school, Yuta wore a suit for their uniform. He sports a long-sleeve shirt that stops at his forearms or a black t-shirt and dark green pants for casual wear.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After transferring to Tokyo Jujutsu High, Yuta received a specialized uniform. Yuta has a loose white jacket with sleeves that stop at his forearms. The rest of his uniform appears to be the usual Jujutsu High dark colors. He also often carries his sword on his back.</p>
